# Malldustry
A Mindustry mod. Random stuff made by me, because either I wanted to or other people wanted me to.  

Currently includes:
- bigger copper and titanium walls (direct scrap reskins)
- the Revolution (a minigun turret)
- a small Mechanical Drill

Not well-balanced. I think. If you really wanted to, you could tell me what to change. I'd (probably) appreciate it.  
You can suggest content ideas [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bex6bGZH8Edi_bAxgYvtgrodqyh1-s17IsR06N01cDo/edit?usp=sharing). You could probably suggest through pull requests, too...?  
Thank you for your time.
