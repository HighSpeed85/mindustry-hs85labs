# Mallpark Labs
A Mindustry mod. Random stuff made by me, because
- I wanted to
- Other people wanted me to
- i think that's it  

Currently includes:
- 3x3 copper wall
- 4x4 copper wall
- 3x3 titanium wall

Not really designed for proper gameplay. I think. I mean, you could make suggestions.  
You can suggest your ideas [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bex6bGZH8Edi_bAxgYvtgrodqyh1-s17IsR06N01cDo/edit?usp=sharing). I'm not too familiar with Github, but possibly you could suggest through issues or pull requests?  
Thank you for your time.
